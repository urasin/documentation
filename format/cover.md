# Cover

To make your book more elegant on GitBook, you can specify a cover.

A cover is specified by a **cover.jpg** file, a **cover_small.jpg** can also exist as a smaller version of the cover. The cover should be a **JPEG** file.

### Best Sizes

|                     |     Big     |       Small       |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
|       **File**      | `cover.jpg` | `cover_small.jpg` |
| **Size(in pixels)** |  1800x2360  |      200x262      |

### Guidelines

A good cover respects the following guidelines:

* No border
* Clearly visible book title
* Any important text should be visible in the small version


### Autocover

A GitBook plugin (`autocover`) can also be used to generate a cover file for you, or just generate the `cover_small.jpg` from your big cover. This plugin is added by default on hosted books.
