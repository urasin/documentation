# Multi-Languages

GitBook supports building books written in multiple languages. Each language should be a sub-directory following the normal GitBook format, and a file named `LANGS.md` should be present at the root of the repository with the following format:

```
* [English](en/)
* [French](fr/)
* [Espa√±ol](es/)
```

You can see a complete example with the [Learn Git](https://github.com/GitbookIO/git) book.
