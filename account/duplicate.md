# Duplicate Account

It occurs that you registered with a Social Account (Facebook, Twitter, GitHub or Google), then registered again using the form.

In this case, you created two distinct accounts (one associated with your email, and another with your Social Account).

You need to **remove** one of these account, to do so:

1. Logout from the account associated with your email
2. Login back using the social account
3. Delete this account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings)
4. Login back using your email
5. Associate the Social Account to your email account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings)
