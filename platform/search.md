# Searching GitBook

You can use [our powerful search tools](https://www.gitbook.com/search) to find what you're looking for among thousands of books on GitBook.

When searching GitBook, you can construct queries that match specific numbers and words.


### Search by text

By default, GitBook search books associated with the keywords from the query. For example `javascript angular` will return all the books that contain the word "javascript" and "angular"

### Exclude results containing a certain word

You can also narrow your search results by excluding words with the `NOT` syntax. Searching for `Hello` returns a massive number of "Hello World" projects, but changing your search to include `hello NOT world` returns fewer results.

### Query for specific field values

You can filter books by including only books with a specific field value. For example: [license:apache-2](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=license%3A%22apache-2%22) returns the list of books with the Apache 2 license.

### Query for values less/greater than another value

You can use `>` or `>=` to indicate "greater than" and "greater than or equal to," respectively. For example, the following search queries are equivalent: `cats stars:">10"` and `cats stars:">= 11"`

You can use `<` and `<=` to indicate "less than" and "less than or equal to," respectively.
