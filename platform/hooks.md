# Webhooks

Webhooks provide a way for notifications to be delivered to an external web server whenever certain actions occur on a book.

Webhooks can be triggered whenever a variety of actions are performed on a book.

You'll need access to an external server and a familiarity with technical procedures in order to set up a new webhook. For help on building a webhook, including a full list of actions you can associate with, visit our [Developer guide](http://developer.gitbook.com/webhooks/index.html).

### Configure a new webhook

You can configure webhooks directly in your book settings:
