You can create a new organization by either setting up a new organization or converting an existing personal account into an organization.

Organizations are great for businesses and large projects that need multiple owners and administrators. For more information on how organizations can help you collaborate on a project, see our [article on the difference between user accounts and organizations](./differences.md).

There are several ways to create an organization.

#### Convert your existing personal account into an organization
