# Transferring organization ownership

To make someone else the owner of an organization account, you must add a new owner, ensure that the billing information is updated, and then remove yourself from the account.

> Removing yourself from the organization does not update the billing information on file for the organization account. The new owner must update the billing information on file to remove your credit card or PayPal information.

1. If you're the only member of the Owners team, add another organization member to the team.

2. Contact the new owner and make sure he or she is able to access the organization's settings.

3. If you are currently responsible for paying for GitBook in your organization, you'll also need to change the organization's billing information to reflect the new owner.

4. Remove yourself from the organization.
