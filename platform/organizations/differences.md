# What's the difference between user and organization accounts?

Your user account is your identity on GitBook. Your user account can be a member of any number of organizations, regardless of whether the account is on a free or paid plan.

#### Personal user accounts

Every person who uses GitBook has their own user account. These accounts include:

* Unlimited public books and collaborators on all plans
* Personal plans for private books and distribution
Ability to add unlimited repository collaborators

#### Organizations

Organizations are great for businesses and large projects that need multiple owners and admins. They include:

* Business plans for private books and distribution
* Collaborators-based access permissions
* Unlimited administrators and collaborators using teams
* Billing receipts that can be sent to a second email address
